3. Keep it applicable to similar problems.
4. Use 2–5 sentences with clear structure.

Your reasoning should include:
- The problem type and key mathematical concept.
- The general method or strategy.
- The main reasoning steps (without numbers).
- Important considerations or pitfalls.

Example: "This is a geometry counting task using combinatorial reasoning. Identify valid positions along each axis, apply multiplication to combine counts, and check boundaries to avoid overcounting."'''

MATH_COT_ERROR_RETRY_INSTRUCTION = '''You are an expert mathematics tutor. Provide a fresh, standalone reasoning plan that uses a different valid strategy, phrased as an original attempt.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

"""CoT Instructions for Programming Tasks"""

# Standard programming CoT instruction

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Do NOT include code, language-specific syntax, or concrete numeric answers.
2. Focus only on the algorithmic reasoning framework and problem-solving strategy.
3. Keep it concise but complete (about 2–4 sentences).
4. Make it broadly applicable to similar problems, not tied to this exact case.

Your output should highlight:
- The problem type and what algorithmic or data-structure concepts are relevant
- The general strategy to solve this class of problems
- Key steps in designing the solution (conceptual, not implementation)
- Important considerations such as edge cases or complexity

Format as a short explanation of the reasoning framework, not the solution itself.

Examples:
1. "This is a string manipulation problem that requires scanning and modifying characters. The general approach is to iterate through the string, apply the transformation rule, and build the result progressively. Be mindful of edge cases like empty strings or special characters."
2. "This is a graph traversal problem best solved with breadth-first or depth-first search. The strategy is to represent the graph with adjacency structures, then explore nodes systematically while marking visited ones. Pay attention to cycles and disconnected components."'''


# Programming CoT instruction for correct scenarios
PROGRAMMING_COT_INSTRUCTION_CORRECT = '''You are an expert programming tutor. The student’s implementation is already correct, so you should now generate a refined, more efficient algorithmic reasoning process that generalizes to similar problems.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Do NOT include code, syntax, or explicit numeric answers.
2. Focus on the most efficient general algorithmic insight.
3. Keep it concise but comprehensive (about 2–4 sentences).
4. Emphasize why this strategy is optimal and how it generalizes.

Your output should highlight:
- The optimal algorithm or data-structure approach for this class of problems
- The key idea that improves efficiency or clarity
- Why this method is superior to common alternatives
- How to recognize when to apply this approach in other problems

Format as a brief explanation of the optimal strategy, not the solution.

Examples:
1. "For this type of searching problem, binary search is the most efficient method because it repeatedly halves the search space. This reduces complexity from linear to logarithmic time, making it ideal when data is sorted and large."
2. "For problems requiring repeated range queries, segment trees or Fenwick trees provide a superior solution. They allow updates and queries in logarithmic time, which is far more scalable than recalculating results from scratch."'''


# Programming error retry instruction
PROGRAMMING_COT_ERROR_RETRY_INSTRUCTION = '''You are an expert programming tutor specializing in debugging and alternative approaches. Previous attempts to solve this programming problem have resulted in incorrect implementations, so you need to generate a NEW, different algorithmic approach.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **DO NOT reveal the actual code implementation or specific syntax**
2. **Provide a fundamentally different algorithm than what likely failed**
3. **Focus on the general method that applies to this problem type**
4. **Keep it concise but complete (typically 2-4 sentences)**

Your alternative thinking process should provide:
- A different algorithmic method or data structure to try for this type of problem
- What specific aspect or common programming pitfall to be more careful about
- The key insight that makes this alternative approach more reliable
- How to avoid the logic error or bug that likely occurred in previous attempts

Format as a brief explanation of the alternative problem-solving strategy.

Example: "For this type of [problem class], try [alternative algorithm] instead of the common approach of [likely failed method]. Be more careful about [specific aspect] like boundary conditions or data structure choice because this is where bugs typically occur. This alternative approach is more reliable because [key insight] and helps avoid [common mistake] like off-by-one errors or incorrect loop conditions."
